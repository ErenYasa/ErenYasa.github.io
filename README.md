- This is a project with the theme of a telecom operator company. That's why I used softnet as a name

- It's my first template design and design done by me.
- I used Flexbox layout and Grid layout. Also, I learned the Grid layout the first time, so I applied it the first time in this project. Thus, I may have made mistakes
- Responsive layout. I used intro images of different sizes for different devices. So, there is one image but three different sizes. In this way, I got exactly a responsive image.
- I learned SASS/SCSS at the first time and I applied at the first time to SCSS. It was great to use it
